## perspective 1

through a description of the components

---

- metal cage (fish trap)
- porcelain pieces
- five pairs of ultra-sound senders/receivers
- five speakers
- a lens-distorted video screen
- cables

__What I learned from Ron Kuivila's Almat residency:__

- you can drive ultra-sound sensors through line I/O of a 96K sound card
- they have a frequency response typically resonant at 40K
- you can either send and receive a signal (e.g. sine), or you can use build-up of feedback
- you can experience Doppler effects as objects, from which ultra-sound beams reflect, move

- __initial situation:__ unknown _n_-dimensional signal, provided as a probability distribution (samples can be taken)
- CHL (1993): incrementally add samples to graph, connect two closest samples (Euclidean distance)
- NG (1991): adapt _k_ nearest centres, with _k_ decreasing over time
- GNG: edge aging, dynamic growth/shrinkage based on error and utility (GNG-U, 1997)
